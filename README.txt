NOTES
- on my windows terminal, cannot view special characters for the card suits; had to change them to char letters

- wasnt sure if the file was supposed to be named TicTacToeGame or TicTacToe according to canvas project instructions

TicTacToeGame.java checkWin() method is not original. method derived from here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1056316/algorithm-for-determining-tic-tac-toe-game-over

- additional tester.java to show experimental work

- i probably could have made the menu interface for TicTacToeGame and Mashup more complex (ex. letting players rechoose X/O or which suit) but honestly im Tired

- ive had previous issues with canvas submissions where chunks of my code would be missing in the version submitted to canvas versus whats actually on my computer. if that happened this time, i have the exact same copies of all my code for this project saved on gitHub:
